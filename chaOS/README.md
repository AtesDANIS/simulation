# chaOS

**Entropy Injector**

## Overview

chaOS is a controlled entropy injection system that allows the system to evolve by introducing controlled chaos. This component enables self-improvement and evolution by breaking existing patterns and forcing adaptation.

## Purpose

chaOS provides:

- Controlled entropy injection
- System evolution mechanisms
- Pattern disruption capabilities
- Adaptive system behavior
- Innovation and mutation drivers

## Architecture Role

chaOS introduces controlled randomness to prevent system stagnation:

- Breaks existing patterns when needed
- Forces system adaptation and evolution
- Enables innovation through controlled chaos
- Maintains system health through controlled disruption

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- theOS (for orchestration of chaos injection)
- anomOS (for monitoring chaos effects)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
