# karmOS

**State Reconciliation & Causality Tracker**

## Overview

karmOS is a blockchain-variant ledger system that tracks causality, state changes, and their relationships. It ensures that all nodes can reconcile their state and understand the causal chain of events that led to the current system state.

## Purpose

karmOS provides:

- Causal chain tracking
- State reconciliation mechanisms
- Distributed ledger functionality
- Event causality relationships
- State consistency guarantees

## Architecture Role

karmOS maintains the causal history of the system:

- Tracks cause-and-effect relationships
- Enables state reconciliation between nodes
- Provides immutable causal records
- Ensures causal consistency across the system

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- logOS (for event logging)
- chronOS (for temporal ordering)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
