# pneumOS

**Energy & Information Transfer Network**

## Overview

pneumOS is the network layer responsible for energy and information transfer. It potentially implements quantum entanglement-like mechanisms for instantaneous communication and energy distribution across vast distances.

## Purpose

pneumOS provides:

- Energy distribution across the system
- Information transfer mechanisms
- Network connectivity management
- Energy-efficient communication
- Instantaneous transfer capabilities

## Architecture Role

pneumOS serves as the circulatory system of the distributed architecture:

- Transfers energy between components
- Enables information exchange
- Maintains network connectivity
- Optimizes transfer efficiency
- Provides communication infrastructure

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- theOS (for network orchestration)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
