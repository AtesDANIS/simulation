# etymOS

**Metadata & Semantic Layer**

## Overview

etymOS manages metadata, semantic relationships, and schema registry functionality. Like word roots in language, this layer maintains the fundamental definitions and relationships that give meaning to all data structures and entities in the system.

## Purpose

etymOS provides:

- Schema registry for all data structures
- Semantic relationship mapping
- Metadata management and versioning
- Type definitions and ontologies
- Meaning and context preservation

## Architecture Role

etymOS acts as the dictionary and grammar of the system, ensuring that:

- All components understand the same data structures
- Semantic relationships are maintained and discoverable
- Schema evolution is managed gracefully
- Meaning is preserved across system boundaries

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- logOS (for schema change logging)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
