## Architecture Role

daemOS manages all background operations:

- Controls daemon processes
- Manages background services
- Orchestrates long-running tasks
- Ensures system maintenance operations
- Keeps the system running autonomously

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- theOS (for process orchestration)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
