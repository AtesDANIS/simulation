**Narrative Consensus Protocol**

## Overview

mythOS is a consensus protocol that ensures all nodes agree on the same narrative or story. It maintains a consistent shared reality by coordinating how different nodes interpret and represent the same events.

## Purpose

mythOS provides:

- Narrative consensus mechanisms
- Shared reality coordination
- Event interpretation alignment
- Story consistency maintenance
- Collective understanding protocols

## Architecture Role

mythOS ensures that all nodes share a common understanding:

- Coordinates event interpretation across nodes
- Maintains narrative consistency
- Ensures shared reality alignment
- Prevents divergent interpretations
- Creates collective understanding

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- logOS (for event logging)
- karmOS (for causal relationships)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
