# atmOS

**Physical World Node**

## Overview

atmOS represents a physical world instance - specifically, a Planet Earth node. This is the concrete implementation layer that interfaces with physical reality, handling all interactions with the material world.

## Purpose

atmOS provides:

- Physical world instance management
- Material reality interface
- Physical node lifecycle management
- Resource management for physical entities
- Interaction with the material domain

## Architecture Role

atmOS serves as the bridge between the abstract distributed system and the concrete physical world. It:

- Manages physical node instances
- Handles material resource allocation
- Interfaces with physical reality constraints
- Provides the concrete implementation layer

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- chronOS (for temporal synchronization)
- theOS (for orchestration)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
