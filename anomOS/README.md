# anomOS

**Anomaly Detection**

## Overview

anomOS continuously monitors the system for anomalies, unexpected behaviors, and deviations from normal operation. It provides early warning systems and detection mechanisms for potential issues.

## Purpose

anomOS provides:

- Anomaly detection and monitoring
- Deviation identification
- Early warning systems
- Pattern recognition for abnormalities
- Alert and notification mechanisms

## Architecture Role

anomOS serves as the watchful eye of the system:

- Monitors all system components
- Detects anomalies and deviations
- Provides early warnings of potential issues
- Identifies patterns that indicate problems
- Enables proactive system management

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- logOS (for event analysis)
- chronOS (for temporal pattern analysis)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
