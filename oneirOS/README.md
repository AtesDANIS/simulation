# oneirOS

**Consciousness Update System**

## Overview

oneirOS works in conjunction with hypnOS to handle background consciousness updates. It manages the processing and integration of new information during offline periods, similar to how dreams process daily experiences.

## Purpose

oneirOS provides:

- Background consciousness updates
- Information integration during offline periods
- Cognitive processing and consolidation
- Experience integration mechanisms
- Mental model updates

## Architecture Role

oneirOS handles the integration of new information into existing knowledge structures:

- Processes experiences during inactive periods
- Integrates new information with existing knowledge
- Updates mental models and representations
- Consolidates learning and experiences

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- hypnOS (for offline processing coordination)
- logOS (for experience logging)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
