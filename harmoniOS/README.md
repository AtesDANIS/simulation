# harmoniOS

**Synchronized Stable Release**

## Overview

harmoniOS represents the state where all nodes are perfectly synchronized and operating in harmony. This is the "stable release" state of the system, where everything is in balance and optimal operation.

## Purpose

harmoniOS provides:

- System synchronization state
- Stable release management
- Harmony and balance maintenance
- Optimal operation state
- System stability guarantees

## Architecture Role

harmoniOS represents the ideal state of the system:

- All nodes are synchronized
- System operates in perfect harmony
- Optimal performance is achieved
- Stability is maintained
- Balance is preserved across all components

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- chronOS (for synchronization)
- theOS (for orchestration)
- All other components (for harmony)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
