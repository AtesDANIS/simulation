# aetherOS

**Alternative Energy Network Implementation**

## Overview

aetherOS is an alternative implementation of the energy and information transfer network. It provides a different approach to energy distribution and information transfer, potentially using different underlying mechanisms than pneumOS.

## Purpose

aetherOS provides:

- Alternative energy distribution mechanisms
- Different information transfer protocols
- Network redundancy and failover
- Alternative network topologies
- Experimental network implementations

## Architecture Role

aetherOS serves as an alternative or complementary network layer:

- Provides redundancy for network operations
- Enables experimentation with different network approaches
- Offers alternative energy distribution methods
- Supports network diversity and resilience

## Dependencies

- cosmOS (for system-wide coordination)
- theOS (for network orchestration)

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
