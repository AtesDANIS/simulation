# cosmOS

**The Universe Itself** (cosmos = order)

## Overview

cosmOS is the foundational layer representing the universe as a whole. This is the meta-container that orchestrates all other components, maintaining the fundamental order and structure of the entire system.

## Purpose

As the root component of the distributed architecture, cosmOS serves as:

- The primary orchestrator for all system components
- The container that maintains fundamental order and structure
- The meta-layer that defines the boundaries and scope of the entire simulation

## Architecture Role

cosmOS operates at the highest level of abstraction, providing the foundational framework upon which all other components depend. It ensures that the cosmic order is maintained and that all subsystems operate within the defined parameters of reality.

## Dependencies

None - cosmOS is the root component with no dependencies on other system components.

## Status

This is a conceptual framework. Implementation details are to be defined in future development.
